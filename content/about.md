###### *We realised that there is money to be made from promotions*
<br>

Whilst short on money, I did the usual of scanning reddit, twitter, and poorly
written news articles all touting the same clichés- surveys, mechanical turks,
blah blah.

I came across a promo code to get money off my utilities, and it got me thinking.
 How many of these promotions were more lucrative than getting £50 off your utilities?
 The unfortunate answer is not much, however with the right attitude beer money
 can turn into genuine passive income. The site is a work in progress but we aim
 to teach you how to take advantage of promo codes, referral codes, crypto
 giveaways.
<br>

### Getting started
###### *A bit of organisation will go a long way.*
<br>

Getting your accounts set up is the most boring part, but with a bit of planning,
 you can get it going fairly fast.
1. Get Google Chrome, and make a memorable email address

*If you already have chrome, make a new user by clicking the add button on the
 dropdown from your profile picture on the top right*

2. Make sure Google passwords is enabled

3. Get an authenticator app (this will allow you to sign up to sites that require
 multi factor authentication)

*These are available on all platforms- pc, mobile, mac etc.*

3. Head to our [home](http://www.cryptopromo.co.uk/) page, and open up as many
 codes as you fancy in seperate tabs (ctrl+shift)

4. Click on the links we provide on each page, setting up accounts and making sure
 your passwords are saved into Google passwords

### Claiming rewards
###### *This can get addictive*

1. Follow the promotion on each site- it may be hidden once you've made the account
 so be sure to log out and follow it from the home page if need be

•Some smaller sites don't apply rewards or other glitches- it's rare but send a
 quick email to support and they will sort it out*

2. Head to your profile, and find your site wallet address

*This is essentially your account number and is used for transferring crypto*

3. Make an excel sheet and note the site, the wallet address, and the type of promotion

*This is where we will split the accounts into their relative uses. Promotions will usually fit into
